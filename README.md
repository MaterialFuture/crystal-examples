# Crystal Lang projects

This is just a repo for me to practice Crystal Lang. I've been practicing a bit of Java and decided to take a look into crystal and see performance as well as compatibility for a future project.

I want to see what crystal can do first-hand and build a couple of things within this test project just to get my feet wet before actually going in and creating an app.

I've added my notes from the notes repo into this one for the sake of convienience.
